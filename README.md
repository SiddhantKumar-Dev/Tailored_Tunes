# Tailored_Tunes
Tailor Tunes is a twitch extension that will allow views to individually decide what music they would like to listen to based on the content being streamed. Our extension has 5 buttons that signify the tension of the content being streamed. Once a button is clicked, a randomly selected song attuned to the excitement level will start playing.
